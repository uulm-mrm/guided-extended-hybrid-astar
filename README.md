## Description
A Hybrid-A* planner with early stopping for efficient path planning.  
Further, the capabilities of the U-Shift vehicles can be activated to enable the extended abilities to rotate around its rear axis.

## Setup
Clone the repository and update the submodules.
```
git submodule update --init --recursive                                                      
```
Change into the docker directory and build the docker image. This may take a while.
```
cd docker
./build.sh
```
Run the docker, everything from here will be executed inside it.
```
./run.sh
```

Follow the instructions given at the start of the docker
```
colcon build  
source colcon_build/install/setup.bash
ros2 run freespace_planner simulation.py
```

## Configuration
### Sim configuration
```src/freespace_planner/ros2/scripts/sim_config/sim_config.yml```  
The SCENARIO_NAME controls which map to use.
ALL_VISIBLE decides if the environment is previously known.

### Library configuration
```
src/freespace_planner/library/config/config.yml  
src/freespace_planner/library/config/params.yml  
```  
Here, all the library params can be adjusted. Some can also be set during runtime in the Gui. 

## Troubleshooting
### GLFW Error
If you receive the error: 
```Could not initialize GLFW!```
Verify that the DISPLAY variable is set to the same value inside the docker as outside with ```echo $DISPLAY```and set it with e.g. ```export DISPLAY=:1``` 

## Contribute
You are welcome to contribute to every part of this project.
Given the fact, that the python part is already planned to be replaced by C++, it would be more beneficial to contribute to the C++ part :)
